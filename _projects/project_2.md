excerpt: "<br> <img src='/images/white_bar.png' style='float:right'> <img src='/images/glycompare.png' width='131' height='178' style='float:right'> GlyCompare is a novel method wherein glycans from glycomic data are decomposed to a minimal set of intermediate substructures, thus incorporating shared intermediate glycan substructures into all comparisons of glycans. It used dynamic motif vectors to map new decomposed motifs thereby facilitating sample crossed comparisons. It inputs includes a glycan abundance table and a variable annotation file and outputs motif abundance table with optional clustering analysis graph.
