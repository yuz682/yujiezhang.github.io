excerpt: "<img src='/images/CardioDT.png' width='131' height='178'> CardioDT is an imageJ-based program to detect and track cardiomyocytes contraction. The input is a microscopic video of cardiomyocytes contraction or other types of cells movements. The user will set threshold to detect cardiomyocytes as regions of interest (ROI) and then the program will calculate the ROI movement data and save it as excel files. It also provides a movement level separation function to cluster the cardiomyocytes with relative contraction degree. "
