GlyCompareCT is a portable command-line tool wrapping up the GlyCompare Python package. Given glycan abundances, GlyCompareCT conducts substructure decomposition to quantify hidden biosynthetic intermediate abundance and relationships between measured glycans. Thus, GlyComparCT mitigates sparsity and makes interdependence explicit, thereby increasing statistical power of downstream analyses of the glycomics data. Ultimately, GlyComparCT increases accessibility, interoperability, scope and consistency in glycomics analysis. It also largely saves the running memory than GlyCompare.
