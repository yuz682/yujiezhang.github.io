I'm currently a senior undergrad major in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics with math minor at the University of California, San Diego. I'm also an undergraduate researcher in [Lewis Lab](http://lewislab.ucsd.edu), a.k.a. Systems Biology And Cell Engineering Lab.

I'm about to start my journey in Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health with a Master of Science in Computational Biology & Quantitative Genetics. I'm excited to step into the next stage exploring computational epigenetics and other genetics related studies. Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or email regarding opportunities or collabrations.
