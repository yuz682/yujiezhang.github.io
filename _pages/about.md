I'm a Biological & Medical Informatics PhD student in UCSF. I'm interested in developing computational methods for a better understanding of biological system and human diseases. Previously, I was a MS student in Harvard and a graduate student researcher in [HLi Lab](https://hlilab.github.io/) at the Data Science Dept. of Dana Farber Cancer Institute and [Hailiang Huang Lab](https://huanglab.ac/) at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
