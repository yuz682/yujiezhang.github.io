I'm currently a MS graduate student under the Biostatistics department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My program is Computational Biology & Quantitative Genetics (CBQG). I'm also a graduate student researcher in [HLi Lab](https://hlilab.github.io/) at the Data Science Dept. of Dana Farber Cancer Institute and [Hailiang Huang Lab](https://huanglab.ac/) at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

I'm currently interested in bioinformatics tool development and statistical genetics anlaysis. Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or email regarding opportunities or collabrations.
