I'm currently a MS graduate student under the Biostatistics department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My program is called Computational Biology & Quantitative Genetics (CBQG). I'm also a graduate student researcher in [HLi Lab](https://hlilab.github.io/) at the Data Science Dept. of Dana Farber Cancer Institute. 

I'm currently interested in analyzing genomics dataset (RNA-seq), developing bioinformatics tools, and exploring genomic algorthms (long read sequencing assembly). Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or email regarding opportunities or collabrations. 

Check the [CV](https://yuz682.github.io/cv/) page to know more about me!
